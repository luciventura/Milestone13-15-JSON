# Milestone13-15-JSON
Shows a Table View with a list of countries. Select the country and see the information about it.

I was having trouble finding an API with a list of countries. So I decided to wright my own JSON file and parse it on my code.
The information about each country is from Wikipedia. 

This is just a draft. This project https://github.com/luciventura/Milestone13-15-Countries is way better written.
